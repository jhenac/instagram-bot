Instagram Follower Bot

The instagram follower bot logs in using facebook credentials direct to the account to be inspected.
It opens the followers of that certain account, scrolls down, and follows the followers of said account.

Note:
1. Some accounts are restricted and shows "requested" instead of "following" and won't be counted
in the account's following list. 
2. Scroll range can be increased for increased following but may require adjustments in the `time.sleep` 
methods.
